gemtc 0.1
===========

Released 2012-10-25

First official release of the GeMTC R package. The  package enables
Bayesian network meta-analysis (also known as MTC, Mixed Treatment
Comparisons) in R. Network meta-analysis models can be generated and
then run using MCMC software: JAGS (using the rjags package), OpenBUGS
(using the BRugs package), WinBUGS (using the R2WinBUGS package) or
YADAS (provided by GeMTC). The GeMTC GUI can be used instead of or in
conjunction with the R package.
