gemtc 0.4
===========

Released 2013-08-09

New features:

 * fixed effect models
 * poisson/log likelihood/link for survival data
 * allow std.err instead of std.dev + sampleSize in continuous data sets

Changes:

 * refuse to generate models when treatments are duplicated in
   multiple arms of the same study, since the code does not take this
   into account.
 * network$data is now network$data.ab for consistency with
   network$data.re
 * likelihood/link implementations can now define their data
   requirements
 * export ll.call for programmatic access to likelihood/link specific
   functions

Bugfixes:

 * multi-arm trial decomposition sometimes resulted in NA standard
   errors
 * WinBUGS and OpenBUGS had complaints about the relative effect code
 * safer matrix indexing: explicit 'drop='
 * safer data frame indexing: use [['x']] instead of $x

gemtc 0.3
===========

Released 2013-07-16

Many additional features:

 * support for relative effect data
 * support for mixed arm-based and relative effect data
 * binom/cloglog likelihood/link for rate data
 * unrelated mean effects (UME) model
 * unrelated study effects (USE) model
 * analysis of heterogeneity with heterogeneity plot (EXPERIMENTAL)
 * full access to generated code, data structures, and parameters
 * guard against "impossible" initial values

Also, bugfixes and documentation updates.

gemtc 0.2
===========

Released 2013-02-18

Dropped Java dependency by rewriting core algorithms in R. 

 * Remove dependency on rJava
 * Use own forest plot methods instead of meta package
 * Fix bug in rank.probabilities when only two treatments in network
 * Various bugfixes
 * Compatibility note: inconsistency models are no longer supported by
   this package
 * Compatibility note: the argument order of mtc.network has changed
 * Compatibility note: the YADAS sampler is no longer available

See [roadmap](http://mantis.drugis.org/roadmap_page.php?version_id=61)
for details.

gemtc 0.1-2
===========

Released 2013-01-21

Bugfix release. Addresses the following issues: 

 * Correct the initial values generation for the random effects standard
   deviation parameter
 * Do not fail on relative.effect when saving and loading samples
 * Make Java open tab-completed paths
 * Use correct column name for continuous data
 * When only YADAS available, run YADAS by default

gemtc 0.1-1
===========

Released 2012-10-30

 * Fix compatibility issue with Java on 32bit Mac OS X. 

gemtc 0.1
===========

Released 2012-10-25

First official release of the GeMTC R package. The  package enables
Bayesian network meta-analysis (also known as MTC, Mixed Treatment
Comparisons) in R. Network meta-analysis models can be generated and
then run using MCMC software: JAGS (using the rjags package), OpenBUGS
(using the BRugs package), WinBUGS (using the R2WinBUGS package) or
YADAS (provided by GeMTC). The GeMTC GUI can be used instead of or in
conjunction with the R package.
